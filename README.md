# StopoverHabitatMonitoring
 This is the repository for all ARU vs Point Count analyses for the Point Abbaye project.
 Main script is StopoverHabitatMonitoring.R -- open this first and follow
 workflow as outlined in that script. 
 
 Note that in order for main workflow script to source, the object "fitbrt" 
 at the top of the BRT_abundance.R script must be assigned "TRUE". The first time 
 the script is sourced, with fitbrt = TRUE, the script will take a long time to run 
 and needs to be run on a computer with at least 16 GB of RAM available.
